# Analysis of Profitable Movies Released between 2010 and 2018

**Author:** Brent Smart

## Overview

This project analyzes profitable movies released between 2010 and 2018 in order to make recommendations to Microsoft as it enters the movie production industry. This analysis uses data from multiple datasets and only contains records of complete and relevant data. It also uses the additional data that was calculated using the complete dataset. The data analysis shows common trends among movies that share at least one of the following genres: Sci-Fi, Animation, and Adventure. Not only were movies of these types more profitable than other combinations of genres, they also generated about 60% of their revenue internationally. Animation movies also over the least competition of the three, ranking 12th out of 22 genres produced (Sci-Fi and Adventure rank 14th and 18th respectively). Given their top performance, it may be helpful for Microsoft to consider focusing on these genres and markets as they enter the movie production industry.

This data analysis aims to answer questions about the budget, genre types, and markets of profitable movies released between 2010-2018. Focusing on the profitable movies may assist Microsoft in initializing its entry into the movie production industry.

## Data
This analysis focuses on top performing movies from 2010-2018. Top performing movies have the highest average ratings and profits. This data uses the public online movie datasets from IMDb, The-Numbers.com, and Box Office Mojo. Each data set provides information essential to answering the questions in this data analysis. Such categories include information on movie titles, genres, lengths, ratings, release year, studios, budgets, profits, and much mor

## Methods

This analysis uses descriptive analysis, including descriptions of trends by genre and market. This provides a useful overview of profitable movies which Microsoft can use as it enters movie production. The data was modeled using bar graphs to get a visual representation of the movie data by genre.

## Results

Animation, Sci-Fi, and Adventure are the most expensive to produce. Animation, Sci-Fi, and Adventure rank as the 12th, 14th, and 18th most produced movie genre. Thus, producing Animation movies may offer the least competition among these three genres.

### Budget by Genre

Animation, Sci-Fi, and Adventure while being the most expensive to produce, yield the most profits of successful movies. 

### Profits by Genre

Foreign markets constitute about 60% of the revenue generated by these genres.

## Conclusions

This data analysis supports the following recommendations for Microsoft as it prepares to produce movies: 
 
1. **Produce movies that are a combination of Sci-Fi, Animation, and or Adventure.** Few movies in the original dataset were of one genre. Most were a combination of 1-2 generes. Of those combinations, Sci-fi, Animation, and Adventure movies outperformed the other genres in terms of profitability and generated the most income domestically and internationally. Of the three, Anime is least produced and Adventure is most produced.
2. **Allocate a movie production budget of about one million US.** Sci-fi, Animation, and Adventure were the three most expensive genres to produce. They were also the three most profitable genres. 
4. **Produce movies that can be marketed both domestically and internationally.** While revenue from each genre is dispersed at varying percentages in both foreign and domestic markets, most of the revenue from those genres were generated in foriegn markets (about 60% of the gross for each genre).



Further analysis could yield different insights:
1. **Models that compare/contrast expected and actual gross data.** This could help with predicting and confirming overall profits.
2. **Models that investigate studios in order to glean best practices.** This model could help with identifying other best practices and potential partners/competitors.
